									Imagine you want to start your own online brand in the food industry. Before you can even begin to sell your product(s), you will encounter several hurdles. First, you’ll need to figure out where to source the best ingredients for a good price. After this you might need to meet with a manufacturer. If you decide to create the products yourself, you’ll be met with a whole slew of health regulations that need to be researched. On top of all these challenges, you must figure out how to effectively market your product in an already competitive industry.
								</p>
								<p>
									Our goal at makeMEchef is to let you focus solely on designing the best, most flavorful product without having to worry about any of these logistical issues. How does it work? makeMEchef will provide forms for different product categories that will let you create your recipe on our platform. For example, if you want to make a spice blend, you would select that as your product category. Then, you’d be prompted to select which base spices to include and their percentage in the spice blend (e.g. 50% rosemary, 45% salt, 5% chili flakes). You can then name your product whatever you’d like and add graphics for the labeling. We will provide you with samplers to make sure the product is up to your standards. Once you’re happy with your masterpiece, you can publish it to the makeMEchef marketplace. Any time someone orders your product, we will make it with our premium ingredients, ship it to the buyer, and send you your cut of the profits!
								</p>
								<p>
									Who owns these products once they are on the makeMEchef website? Simple - YOU! We plan to make each recipe on our platform an NFT (essentially a digital asset that someone can own). The holder of the NFT is the one who collects the profits of that product. We will also develop a marketplace for the NFTs themselves, where product creators can buy and sell their creations.
								</p>
								<p>
									If you're interested in becoming a chef on our platform or just curious to see what kinds of recipes other people come up with, please join our mailing list to stay updated! We are also giving away FREE keychains to anyone who takes either of these <a href="#survey">two surveys</a>!

								<h2 class="major">Roadmap</h2>


								<h2 class="phase">Phase 1: MVP</h2>
								<p class="phasedesc">
									Initially, we will build a minimum viable product where users will be able to create custom spice blends, dry rubs, seasonings, and teas.
								</p>


								<h2 class="phase">Phase 2: Expansion</h2>
								<p class="phasedesc">
									Once we gain some traction, we will expand the site to handle more complex products such as sauces, drinks, baked goods, and more.
								</p>

								<h2 class="phase">Phase 3: Moon</h2>
								<p class="phasedesc">
									By this point we'll be able to handle many different kinds of product categories. Our focus will be on expanding internationally and vertically integrating the business.
